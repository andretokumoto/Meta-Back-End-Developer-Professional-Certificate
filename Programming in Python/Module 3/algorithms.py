Exercise: Make a cup of coffee
Introduction
In this exercise, you will practice the use of an algorithm to make a cup of instant coffee. The purpose is to lay out the steps required in order to get the final product. 

Instructions
Step 1: Start with the inputs - what is needed to make a cup of instant coffee?

Step 2: Think about all the steps required in the physical aspect of making a cup of instant coffee.

Step 3: Consider the edge cases of optional things like milk or sugar, some people may want it. 

Step 4: The algorithm when complete should have as its final result a cup of coffee.

Tips: Planning is key with any algorithm. Make sure you have all the steps neatly laid out.
